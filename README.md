# Londinium - An example city of a transport ABM.

The Londinium is more relastic dataset than Test Town that we can use it for testing our tools. 

The Londinium dataset is comprised of:

- an OSM data file covering a region in west London
- a GTFS public transit schedule for the same geographical area
- a synthetic MATSim population of 100 agents with travel plans inside this region


It has been used to generate some scenarios' [data](https://github.com/arup-group/ersa/tree/main/data) using [matesto](https://github.com/arup-group/matesto) pipelines.

More information about the londinium can be found from this [link](https://github.com/arup-group/matesto/blob/main/data/londinium/DATASET.md)

The generation of londinium population are from a [notebook](https://github.com/arup-group/pam/blob/main/examples/04_Example-Create-Population-Londinium.ipynb) in [pam](https://github.com/arup-group/pam)
