MODES:
  # This is used for subsetting appropriate graphs, it is how puma knows that buses in GTFS should be put on the OSM
  # network with car and bus mode allowed on it. MODE_SUBGROUPS:Mode is a 'mode' (lowercase) that MATSim will need to
  # understand, as an addition in your MATSim config or otherwise. Check out src/outputs_handling/matsim_xml_values.py
  # for ideas
  MODE_SUBGROUPS:
    Bus:
      OSM:
        - car
        - bus

  MODE_INDICATORS:
    # These refer to tags stored in OSM, the mode assignment to tags is manual and definitely not exhaustive. The
    # tags that are not understood by puma will be logged and can be reviewed before proceeding with building the network.
    # if a tag is not listed here, it will not be read into the network. This is where you should define how dense
    # you want your network to be. If any of these tags don't have values defined for them in
    # src/outputs_handling/matsim_xml_values.py, it will default to DEFAULT_OSM_TAG_VALUE
